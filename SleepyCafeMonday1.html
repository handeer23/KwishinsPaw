                <p>Monday</p>
                <p>The cafe clock struck 8 o'clock in the morning, 
                    when a new customer entered the Sleepy Eye Cafe. 
                    Melody sat behind the mahogany coffee counter, 
                    the barstool gently squeaking as she slowly 
                    rotated back and forth, reading a graphic novel. 
                    The blue and pink characters on the front 
                    suggested it was some sort of fantasy romance 
                    set in a big city, but this New Face was annoyed 
                    that this airheaded teenager had the gall to 
                    ignore a paying customer. He would later say his 
                    name was Clark, and Melody would intentionally 
                    call him Clerk, much to his annoyance, and 
                    everyone else’s amusement.</p>
                <p>	“Ahem!” the New Face cleared his throat loud 
                    enough to disturb Grandmother Ganz in her winter
                    nap by the hearth…in the back room.</p>
                <p>New Face was ignorant of the sudden silence that 
                    befell the cafe patrons as they stared at his 
                    back, clad in a too stiff black suit covered in 
                    lint and beginning to wrinkle where he obviously 
                    had sat for his daily commute. To use the old 
                    cliche, “if looks could kill", some of the 
                    patrons would have been charged with 
                    Second-degree murder. However, most of the 
                    patrons mainly stared in varying degrees of 
                    surprise, curiosity, intrigue and annoyance.</p>
                <p>Melody, however, still looked at her book. She 
                    finished her page. And then, slowly, lifted her 
                    eyes to the New Face. She stared. He stared. 
                    Then, with a lovely little huff that could only 
                    be described as indignant, New Face spoke again.</p>
                <p>“I want an Americano. Hot. To go.” He was pulling 
                    out his credit card. </p>
                <p>“Are you sure you want the Americano? Today?” 
                    Melody asked. She had moved to the register, and 
                    was now studying New Face with a look of mild 
                    concern. New Face did not appreciate the tone in 
                    which she had asked. Something had stirred in his 
                    gut, suggesting that he better listen to this teen. 
                    But the feeling was quickly overruled by the 
                    absurdity that a teenaged barista would know what 
                    was better for him than he himself. </p>
                <p>“What? Yes! Just, give me my Americano.” </p>
                <p>“Okaay…but you’re gonna have to drink it here. 
                    Can’t very well let a paying customer leave in this 
                    weather. Not with a good conscience. And I like 
                    adding up good karma points. Never know when 
                    they’ll come in handy.” Melody said. “Name?”</p>
                <p>“Huh? Wha? Weather? Karma? Name?” Confused, New 
                    Face was lost in all this conversation between 
                    being told what to do, something about bad weather 
                    on a slightly chilly, but definitely sunny, autumn 
                    day, good karma, and now a name? This girl was weird.</p>
                <p>“A name for the order?” Melody asked. </p>
                <p>“Oh, uh, Clark.” He handed her the card. “I want 
                    it to go.”</p>
                <p>While Melody made the man his hot Americano, Clark 
                    looked around the cafe for the first time. It was 
                    like any other coffee shop he’d seen…and not. He 
                    didn’t like it. And then he noticed the windows.</p>
                <p>What was he seeing? Or better yet, not seeing. The 
                    world beyond the windows was nothing but white 
                    flurries. The panes of the glass had frosted. He 
                    could hear the howl of the winds seeping through 
                    the cracks. When had it gotten so cold? And when had 
                    it started snowing? </p>
                <p>He found an empty seat and slowly sat, his eyes still 
                    fixated on the blizzard outside. </p>
                <p>“Clerk.” Clark jumped at the voice. Melody was 
                    standing by the pick-up counter, a paper coffee cup 
                    in hand. Clerk was written on it.</p>
                <p>As he was turning to leave the pick up counter with 
                    his newly acquired Americano, Melody stopped him.</p>
                <p>“Seriously. You can’t leave here in that weather. 
                    You’ll get lost. Or worse.” She pointed to an empty 
                    table. “There’s an empty table. You can wait the storm 
                    out there.” </p>
                <p>“Fine.” He took his cup and sat at the table. She 
                    returned to her book. </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>...</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Soon after the clock struck 9 am, Melody noticed a 
                    rather pale and shaking Clerk quickly scurry from his 
                    table to the nearest trash bin. He kept looking around 
                    him. There was sweat on his brow, his tie had been 
                    loosened and the top two buttons of his shirt undone. 
                    He gently placed the cup in the bin, leaving the lid, a 
                    half-opened creamer carton and two empty sugar packets 
                    on the table.</p>
                <p>“Did you not like the coffee?” The man jumped at the 
                    sound of Melody’s voice. He turned and saw that she had 
                    seen his dastardly deed. Instead of answering, he stared 
                    horror-stricken. He took two steps back before turning 
                    and dashing for the door. When he opened it, a gust of 
                    fresh autumn air swept around him, bringing with it a 
                    couple of crisp leaves. He left the door wide open as he 
                    ran to his car, almost getting hit by a boy on a bike in 
                    the process.</p>
                <p>Melody pulled the still full cup from the bin and gently 
                    shut the cafe door. She looked into the coffee.</p>
                <p>“He really should have gone with the latte he wanted. It 
                    would have been kinder.” She tutted, almost, to herself.</p>

                <p>Monday</p>
                <p>The cafe clock struck 8 o'clock in the morning, when a new 
                    customer entered the Sleepy Eye Cafe.</p>
                <p>Melody sat behind the mahogany coffee counter, the 
                    barstool gently squeaking as she slowly rotated back and 
                    forth, reading a graphic novel. The blue and pink 
                    characters on the front suggested it was some sort of 
                    fantasy romance set in a big city, but the customer wasn’t 
                    interested in colorful manhwas or fantastical stories.</p>
                <p>Instead, he was annoyed that the teenage barista would have 
                    the gall to ignore a paying customer. He would later say 
                    his name was Clark, and Melody would intentionally call him 
                    Clerk, much to his annoyance, and her amusement.</p>
                <p>“Ahem!” he cleared his throat loud enough to disturb the 
                    quiet chatter of the other customers. He, ignorant of the 
                    sudden silence that befell the cafe patrons as they stared 
                    at him, waited for Melody to respond. </p>
                <p>Melody, however, still looked at her book. She finished her 
                    page. Turning her chair with a painfully elongated squeak, 
                    her eyes slowly lifted to the man.</p>
                <p>She stared.</p>
                <p>He stared.</p>
                <p>Then, with a lovely little huff that could only be described 
                    as indignant, he spoke again.</p>

                <p>“Huh? Wha? Weather? Karma? Name?” He was lost in all this 
                    conversation between a lingering sense of warning, something 
                    about bad weather, good karma, and now a name? This girl was 
                    weird…and scary.</p>
                <p>“A name for the order?” Melody asked.</p>
                <p>“Oh, uh, Clark.” He handed her the card. “I want it to go.”</p>
                <p>While Melody made the man his hot Americano, Clark looked around 
                    the cafe for the first time. It was like any other coffee shop 
                    he’d seen…and not. He couldn’t say why, but this place was like 
                    her. He didn’t like it.</p>
                <p>Then he noticed the windows. </p>
                <p>What was he seeing? Or better yet, not seeing. The world beyond 
                    the glass was nothing but white flurries. The panes were frosted. 
                    He could hear the howl of the winds seeping through the cracks.</p>
                <p>It had been a beautiful, cool autumn day. The sky was clear. The 
                    weather report had promised nothing but a slight chill, light 
                    breeze, and sunny skies. How… how was there a furious blizzard 
                    outside?</p>
                <p>He found an empty seat and slowly sat, his eyes still fixated on 
                    the white wall of snow outside.</p>
                <p>“Clerk.” Clark jumped at the voice. Melody was standing by the 
                    pick-up counter, a paper coffee cup in hand. Clerk was written

                    acquired Americano, Melody stopped him.</p>

                    Melody’s voice. He turned and saw that she had been watching. 
                    Instead of answering, he took two steps back before turning and 
                    dashing for the door.</p>
